# Root - Ticket Alerter
#
# Author: Raach 'Unabated' Brian
#
# Description: This little and dirty script will Alert you whenever you received a Ticket.
#
# How to use: I signed the extension and you can now download it from my github: https://github.com/Unabated/Ticket-Alerter/blob/master/Ticket-Alerter/root_ticket_alerter-1.0-an%2Bfx.xpi. Right-click the xpi, run with firefox. It will open a new TAB and it will ask you if you want to install the extension. The extension should now start everytime you open firefox.
