# Root - Ticket Alerter
#
# Author: Raach 'Unabated' Brian
#
# Description: This little and dirty script will Alert you whenever you received a Ticket.
#
# How to use: Download the Ticket-Alerter folder and extract it anywhere on your PC. Open Firefox and type into the adresse bar without ticks: 'about:debugging'. On that menu you press the 'Load Temporary Add-on' button and navigate to where you saved the Ticket-Alerter folder and select the 'manifest' to open. That's it the script is running now. Enjoy.
# You need to run the script everytime you close firefox. Else I'll need to get my script signed by mozilla.
